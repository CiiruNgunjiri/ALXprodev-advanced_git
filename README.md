# ALXprodev-advanced_git

Welcome to the **ALXprodev-advanced_git** repository! This project contains advanced exercises and implementations to master Git and the GitFlow workflow.

---

## 📋 Overview

- Feature branches for implementing **login** and **signup** pages  
- Release branches following the **GitFlow** branching model  
- Automated Git hooks for:  
  - Pre-commit checks ensuring each directory has a **README** file  
  - Post-merge logging for merges into the **main** branch  

---

## 🚀 Usage

Follow the GitFlow branching strategy to manage your work efficiently:

1. Develop new features in **feature/** branches  
2. Prepare releases in **release/** branches  
3. Merge finished releases into **main** for production  
4. Use **develop** as the integration branch for ongoing development  

---

## 🤝 Contributing

- Please add a **README** file to every new directory you create  
- Follow commit message conventions, e.g., `feat: add signup feature` or `docs: update README`  
- Keep branches and merges aligned with GitFlow best practices
